# builder

Advanced page/email builder based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## What is this

This builder (sections builder) reuses your Vue components as **editable sections** to produce an interactive page builder to the end user, you can use it as a prototyping tool as well as it is sort-of a block builder.

The user/developer can then export the builder for usability in multiple formats, the following are the officially supported ones:

- `json` A json object which can be later used to re-render a page, particualry useful if you plan to have dynamic pages or want to store them in a Database.
- `preview` opens a new page without the editable logic in new tap to see the end result.
- `pwa` produces a zip file which contains all the page files and images neatly packed, this is probably the format you will use for page/prototype landing page builder, The project is augmented by default with service workers to support offline viewing.

The builder is just a Vue plugin, so you can integrate this into your own projects without needing to create seperate bundles for it.

## Installation

### Package managers

First step is to install it using `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
npm install @baianat/builder

# or use yarn
yarn add @baianat/builder
```

### CDNs

Or add it as a script tag in your projects.

- [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/@baianat/builder@latest)

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@2.4.2"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@baianat/builder@latest"></script>
```

### Usage

> **If you added it using a script tag, you can skip this section. as it will be auto-installed for you**

```js
import Builder from '@baianat/builder';

Vue.use(Builder);
```

You can start using the `b-builder` component to build things now.

This package does not include any sections. The builder is just a system of helpers for managing customizable sections, seeding fake data, exporting views and re-rendering them. The logic for your components/sections is written by you eventually. **we will be adding a huge number of sections soon to be used with this one**. You can use the included examples after reading the API to build your own for now.

## API

<!-- > Examples use [NARX](https://github.com/baianat/NARX) patterns library for grid and UI elements. -->
> Examples use [pug](https://pugjs.org) template language to make it easier to work with templates.

### Injected Properties and Methods

Your section components will have some properties injected to help you customize their behavior in building phase and production/render phase.

#### $section

An instance of the [section class](https://github.com/baianat/builder/blob/master/src/js/section.js) that represents this component.

#### $builder

An instance of the singleton [builder class](https://github.com/baianat/builder/blob/master/src/js/builder.js)

#### $sectionData

Is a computed property that mirriors `$section.data` which contains the current values (text, images, etc...) for the section.

### Section

A section is the building block of the page, below is an example of a header section.

```pug
<template lang="pug">
  section.header(
    v-styler="$sectionData.classes"
    :class="[{'is-editable': $builder.isEditing}, $sectionData.classes]"
  )
    .container
      .grid
        .column.is-screen-6.add-center-vertical
          h3.header-title(
            :class="{'is-editable': $builder.isEditing}"
            v-html="$sectionData.title"
            v-styler="$sectionData.title"
          )
          p.header-content(
            :class="{'is-editable': $builder.isEditing}"
            v-html="$sectionData.content"
            v-styler="$sectionData.content"
          )
          a.button(
            :class="[{'is-editable': $builder.isEditing}, $sectionData.button.classes]"
            :href="$sectionData.button.href"
            v-html="$sectionData.button.text"
            v-styler="$sectionData.button"
          )
        .column.is-screen-6
          uploader(
            class="header-image"
            path="$sectionData.images[0]"
          )
</template>

<script>
  import { types } from '@baianat/builder';

  export default {
    name: 'hero1',
    cover: '../covers/hero1.png',
    $schema: {
      title: types.Title,
      content: types.Text,
      images: [types.Image],
      button: types.Button,
      classes: types.ClassList
    },
    props: {
      id: Number
    }
  };
</script>
```

Each section has several elements that can be edited. Elements data are stored in `$sectionData` object which is reactive.

So, how you can make any element editable

1. Add `is-editable` class to it. since editable state can be toggled off/on it always good to bind is-editable class to change when editing mode changes `:class="{'is-editable': $builder.isEditing}"`
1. Add [`v-styler`](https://github.com/baianat/builder#v-styler) directive to the element
1. Updates the elementâ€™s innerHTML when data changes like this `v-html="$sectionData.button.text"`
1. If you have any other data that `v-styler` changes you have to update it too e.g. `:href="$sectionData.button.href"`

Put all toghter

```html
  <a
    :class="[{'button', 'is-editable': $builder.isEditing}, $sectionData.button.classes]"
    :href="$sectionData.button.href"
    v-html="$sectionData.button.text"
    v-styler="$sectionData.button"
  ></a>
```

After creating the HTML structure you should configure the section schema to use the built in seeder to provide you with initial/fake values when the component is instantiated in build/edit mode.

```html
<script>
  import { types } from '@baianat/builder';

  export default {
    // section name
    name: 'hero1',
    // section cover image
    cover: '../cover-hero1.png',
    // group mutiple sections
    group: 'heros',
    // section data schema
    $schema: {
      // main title
      title: types.Text,
      // main content
      content: types.Text,
      // section classese
      classes: types.ClassList,
      // array of section's images
      images: [
        types.Image,
        types.Image
      ],
      // object holds button data, href etc..
      button: types.Button,
      // if section has many columns you can use
      // columns to sperate each column date
      columns: [
      {
        title: types.Title,
        content: types.Text,
        // grid object use for responsive classes
        grid: {
          mobile: '',
          tablet: '',
          screen: 'is-screen-5',
          widescreen: ''
        }
      },
      {
        title: types.Title,
        content: types.Text
      }
    ]
    },
    props: {
      id: Number // it is required to have an id prop.
    }
  };
</script>
```

you can add the `schema` values directly without using types, but it's better to use types

```js
$schema: {
  // main title
  title: 'The section title',
  // main content
  content: 'The section content,
}
```

### v-styler

<<<<<<< HEAD
It's responsable for editing elements you have to provide the data type and the variable which it will update.

To tell styler which variable to update you pass it as directive expression e.g. `v-styler="$sectionData.button"`

The styler directive has four types text, button, column or section by default it can know the type from the element tag or from provided schema. but if you want to sepcify the type you can pass it as directive argument e.g. `v-styler:button="$sectionData.button"`.
=======
This directive is automatically injected in your section components, and can be used to facilitate editing elements greatly since it has support for multiple elements types like `div`, `a`, `button` and `p` tags as well.
>>>>>>> 6c81efb8e421eefa2ac47e4f6dc740f10c8d71b1

To tell styler which variable to update you pass it as directive expression e.g.: `v-styler="$sectionData.button"`

The styler directive has three types `text`, `button`, or `section`. By default the directive can tell the type from the element tag or from provided schema. 

If you want to sepcify the type you can pass it as a directive modifier e.g.: `v-styler.button="$sectionData.button"`.

### Using the section

Until now we have only been creating our section component, we now need to introduce it to our builder so it can use it:

```js
import Builder from '@baianat/builder';
import section from './components/sections/section';

// Builder has Vue-like API when registering components.
Builder.component(section);
Vue.use(Builder);

new Vue({
  el: '#app'
});
```

```html
<div id="app">
  <b-builder></b-builder>
</div>
```

You only have to register the component on the Builder plugin, which has a Vue-like API. This ensures your Vue global scope isn't polluted by the builder and keeps everything contained within the `b-builder` component.

### Exporting

There is three ways to export the built page: preview, pwa or json. When clicking the save button the `b-builder` component emits a saved event with the builder instance as its payload, which exposes a `export` method.

```html
<div id="app">
  <b-builder @saved="onSave"></b-builder>
</div>

<script>

  new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  methods: {
    onSave (builder) {
      // you can use 'preview', 'pwa' or 'json' strings
      // 'json' is the default exproting mode
      builder.export('preview');
    }
  }
});
</script>
```
