# builder

> **This is still a work-in-progress and not ready for production**

Advanced page builder based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## What is this?

This builder (sections builder) reuses your Vue components which we will can **editable sections** to produce an interactive page builder to the end user, you can use it as a prototyping tool as well as it is sort-of a block builder.

The user/developer can then export the builder for usability in the following formats:

- `zip` produces a zip file which contains all the page files and images neatly packed, this is probably what will your end users will use.
- `preview` opens a new page without the editable logic in new tap to see the end result.
- `json` A json object which can be later used to re-render built page, particualry useful if you plan to have dynamic pages or want to store them in a Database.

All this functionality is exposed as a Vue.js plugin, which means you can integrate it in your own projects that may need this functionality.

## Installation

### Package managers

First step is to install it using `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
npm install @baianat/builder

# or use yarn
yarn add @baianat/builder
```

### CDNs

Or add it as a script tag in your projects.

- [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/@baianat/builder@latest)

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@2.4.2"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@baianat/builder@latest"></script>
```

### Usage

> **If you added it using a script tag, you can skip this section. as it will be auto-installed for you**

```js
import Builder from '@baianat/builder';

Vue.use(Builder);
```

And you are done, the builder is installed, you can start using the `b-builder` component to build things now.

But that does not accomplish much, you can't build sections without having any. This repository only contains the core package, **we will be adding a huge number of sections soon to be used with this one**. You can use the included examples after reading the API to build your own for now.

## API

### Section

complete example for working section
> Here we use [NARX](https://github.com/baianat/NARX) patterns library for grid and UI elements.
> We using [pug](https://pugjs.org) languge to focus more on the working code.

```pug
<template lang="pug">
  section.header(
    v-styler="$sectionData.classes"
    :class="[{'is-editable': $builder.isEditing}, $sectionData.classes]"
  )
    .container
      .grid
        .column.is-screen-6.add-center-vertical
          h3.header-title(
            :class="{'is-editable': $builder.isEditing}"
            v-html="$sectionData.title"
            v-styler="$sectionData.title"
          )
          p.header-content(
            :class="{'is-editable': $builder.isEditing}"
            v-html="$sectionData.content"
            v-styler="$sectionData.content"
          )
          a.button(
            :class="[{'is-editable': $builder.isEditing}, $sectionData.button.classes]"
            :href="$sectionData.button.href"
            v-html="$sectionData.button.text"
            v-styler="$sectionData.button"
          )
        .column.is-screen-6
          uploader(
            class="header-image"
            path="$sectionData.images[0]"
          )
</template>

<script>
  import { types } from '@baianat/builder';

  export default {
    name: 'hero1',
    cover: '../covers/hero1.png',
    $schema: {
      title: types.Title,
      content: types.Text,
      images: [types.Image],
      button: types.Button,
      classes: types.ClassList
    },
    props: {
      id: Number
    }
  };
</script>
```

Each section has several elements that can be edit
we store elements data in `$sectionData` object to be able to track them and update Vue data

So, how you can make any element editable

1. Add `is-editable` class to it. since editable state can be toggled off/on it always good to bind is-editable class to change when editing mode changes `:class="{'is-editable': $builder.isEditing}"`
1. Add [`v-styler`](https://github.com/baianat/builder#v-styler) directive to the element
1. Updates the elementâ€™s innerHTML when data changes like this `v-html="$sectionData.button.text"`
1. If you have any other data that `v-styler` changes you have to update it too e.g. `:href="$sectionData.button.href"`

Put all toghter

```html
  <a
    :class="[{'button', 'is-editable': $builder.isEditing}, $sectionData.button.classes]"
    :href="$sectionData.button.href"
    v-html="$sectionData.button.text"
    v-styler="$sectionData.button"
  ></a>
```

After create HTML structure you have to config the section schema for instance

```html
<script>
  import { types } from '@baianat/builder';

  export default {
    // section name
    name: 'hero1',
    // section cover image
    cover: '../cover-hero1.png',
    // group mutiple sections
    goup: 'heros',
    // section data schema
    $schema: {
      // main title
      title: types.Text,
      // main content
      content: types.Text,
      // section classese
      classes: types.ClassList,
      // array of section's images
      images: [
        types.Image,
        types.Image
      ],
      // object holds button data, href etc..
      button: types.Button,
      // if section has many columns you can use
      // columns to sperate each column date
      columns: [
      {
        title: types.Title,
        content: types.Text
      },
      {
        title: types.Title,
        content: types.Text
      }
    ]
    },
    // you have to allow id prop in section
    props: {
      id: Number
    }
  };
</script>
```

you can add the `schema` values directly without using types, but it's better to use types

```js
$schema: {
  // main title
  title: 'The section title',
  // main content
  content: 'The section content,
}
```

### v-styler

It's responsable for editing elements you have to provide the data type and the variable which it will update.

To tell styler which variable to update you pass it as directive expression e.g. `v-styler="$sectionData.button"`

The styler directive has three types text, button or section by default it can know the type from the element tag or from provided schema. but if you want to sepcify the type you can pass it as directive argument e.g. `v-styler.button="$sectionData.button"`.

### uploader

It's responsable for uploading section images.

`uploader` is a Vue component, it renders a `img` wrraped by `div` tag. you have to provide the variable that uploader is going to update it's value using `path` prop.

```html
<uploader path="$sectionData.images[0]"></uploader>
```

### use section

Untile now the builder doesn't know about our section. so, we have to config it.

```js
import Builder from '@baianat/builder';
import section1 from './components/sections/section1';

Builder.component(section1);
Vue.use(Builder);

new Vue({
  el: '#app'
});
```

```html
<div id="app">
  <b-builder></b-builder>
</div>
```

### export

There is three ways to export the output page preview, zip or JSON. on click export button it emits `saved` event so in builder component you have to tell which export mode to listen.

```html
<div id="app">
  <b-builder @saved="onSave"></b-builder>
</div>

<script>

  new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  methods: {
    onSave (builder) {
      // you can use preview, zip or JSON srtings
      // JSON is the default exproting mode
      builder.export('preview');
    }
  }
});
</script>
```
